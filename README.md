C# Hello World Sample to Asm.js

My attempt to write a Hello World! sample application that can be converted into Asm.js

First convert into C++ with C# Native (http://csnative.codeplex.com) and then to convert into JavaScript with Emscripten (http://emscripten.org)

# Impediment:

EMscripten can't compile the C++ generated by C# Native.
